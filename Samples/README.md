### IP lookup

The IP address lookup sample requires a sample IP address. You should enter your IPv4 or IPv6 IP address as the [`IPAddress` value](https://github.com/lewisbennett/weatherapi-Net-Standard/blob/master/Samples/Sample.IPLookup/Program.cs#L9), for example:

```
public const string IPAddress = "127.0.0.1";
```
